            We hear Alan Turing saying, "Are you paying attention? Good. 
            If you're not listening carefully, you will miss things. 
            Important things. I will not pause, I will not repeat myself, 
            and you will not interrupt me. You think that because you're 
            sitting where you are and I am sitting where I am, that you are in 
            control of what is about to happen. You are mistaken. I am in 
            control. Because I know things that you do not know. 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            What I need from you now is a commitment. You will listen closely 
            and you will not judge me until I am finished. If you cannot commit 
            to this, then please leave the room. But if you choose to stay, 
            remember that you chose to be here. What happens from this moment 
            forward is not my responsibility. It's yours. Pay attention."

            In a flashback to September 1939 in London, War has been declared 
            with 800,000 people being evacuated from their homes. On the train, 
            a 27-year-old Alan Turing 

            <!-- creazione del link -->

            admires a kid doing
            crossword puzzles. He arrives at Bletchley Park, guarded by Royal 
            Naval officers. He waits in the office of Commander Denniston 
            (Charles Dance). When the Commander arrives, Alan is cold and seems 
            to lack humour. The Commander asks why Alan wants to work for the 
            government; he replies he doesn't. He mentions that he's not 
            very political and the Commander says it may be the shortest job 
            interview ever. Alan mentions he doesn't speak German but tells the 
            Commander that he's one of the best mathematicians in the world. 
            He considers German codes to be like puzzles, which he enjoys 
            solving. The Commander calls for Alan to be removed by his 
            secretary so Alan mentions Enigma, revealing he knows about the 
            top secret program he's being considered for. Alan explains that 
            Enigma is the greatest encryption device in history and if the 
            Allies can crack the code, it will end the war. The Commander 
            says everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable. Alan says to let him 
            try and they'll know for sure.
